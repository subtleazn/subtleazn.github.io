        <h1>16 Personality Types</h1>
        <p class="center"><em>Homework #5 CCNIT 131H by Nash Ang</em></p>
        
        <p class="center"><strong>Everyone wants to learn about themselves. This assessment is based on the 16 personality types that were developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator">Isabel Briggs Myers and Katharine Cook Briggs</a>, which was built on the work of Carl Jung in the early 1900s. What’s your personality type?</strong></p>

        <h2>The Inspector – ISTJ Personality</h2>
        <p>At first glance, ISTJs are intimidating. They appear serious, formal, and
            proper. They also love traditions and old-school values that uphold patience,
            hard work, honor, and social and cultural responsibility. They are reserved,
            calm, quiet, and upright. These traits result from the combination of I, S, T,
            and J, a personality type that is often misunderstood.</p>

        <h2>The Counselor – INFJ Personality</h2>
        <p>INFJs are visionaries and idealists who ooze creative imagination and brilliant
            ideas. They have a different, and usually more profound, way of looking at the
            world. They have a substance and depth in the way they think, never taking
            anything at surface level or accepting things the way they are. Others may
            sometimes perceive them as weird or amusing because of their different outlook
            on life.</p>

        <h2>The Mastermind – INTJ Personality</h2>
        <p>INTJs, as introverts, are quiet, reserved, and comfortable being alone. They are
            usually self-sufficient and would rather work alone than in a group. Socializing
            drains an introvert’s energy, causing them to need to recharge. INTJs are
            interested in ideas and theories. When observing the world they are always
            questioning why things happen the way they do. They excel at developing plans
            and strategies, and don’t like uncertainty.</p>

        <h2>The Giver – ENFJ Personality</h2>
        <p>ENFJs are people-focused individuals. They are extroverted, idealistic,
            charismatic, outspoken, highly principled and ethical, and usually know how to
            connect with others no matter their background or personality. Mainly relying on
            intuition and feelings, they tend to live in their imagination rather than in
            the real world. Instead of focusing on living in the “now” and what is currently
            happening, ENFJs tend to concentrate on the abstract and what could possibly
            happen in the future.</p>

        <h2>The Craftsman – ISTP Personality</h2>
        <p>ISTPs are mysterious people who are usually very rational and logical, but also
            quite spontaneous and enthusiastic. Their personality traits are less easily
            recognizable than those of other types, and even people who know them well can’t
            always anticipate their reactions. Deep down, ISTPs are spontaneous,
            unpredictable individuals, but they hide those traits from the outside world,
            often very successfully.</p>

        <h2>The Provider – ESFJ Personality</h2>
        <p>ESFJs are the stereotypical extroverts. They are social butterflies, and their
            need to interact with others and make people happy usually ends up making them
            popular. The ESFJ usually tends to be the cheerleader or sports hero in high
            school and college. Later on in life, they continue to revel in the spotlight,
            and are primarily focused on organizing social events for their families,
            friends and communities. ESFJ is a common personality type and one that is liked
            by many people.</p>
        
        <h2>The Idealist – INFP Personality</h2>
        <p>INFPs, like most introverts, are quiet and reserved. They prefer not to talk
            about themselves, especially in the first encounter with a new person. They
            like spending time alone in quiet places where they can make sense of what is
            happening around them. They love analyzing signs and symbols, and consider
            them to be metaphors that have deeper meanings related to life. They are lost
            in their imagination and daydreams, always drowned in the depth of their
            thoughts, fantasies, and ideas.</p>

        <h2>The Performer – ESFP Personality</h2>
        <p>ESFPs have an Extraverted, Observant, Feeling and Perceiving personality, and
            are commonly seen as Entertainers. Born to be in front of others and to
            capture the stage, ESFPs love the spotlight. ESFPs are thoughtful explorers
            who love learning and sharing what they learn with others. ESFPs are “people
            people” with strong interpersonal skills. They are lively and fun, and enjoy
            being the center of attention. They are warm, generous, and friendly,
            sympathetic and concerned for other people’s well-being.</p>

        <h2>The Champion – ENFP Personality</h2>
        <p>ENFPs have an Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Perceiving personality. This
            personality type is highly individualistic and Champions strive toward
            creating their own methods, looks, actions, habits, and ideas — they do not
            like cookie cutter people and hate when they are forced to live inside a box.
            They like to be around other people and have a strong intuitive nature when it
            comes to themselves and others. They operate from their feelings most of the
            time, and they are highly perceptive and thoughtful.</p>
         
        <h2>The Doer – ESTP Personality</h2>
        <p>ESTPs have an Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking, and Perceptive personality.
            ESTPs are governed by the need for social interaction, feelings and emotions,
            logical processes and reasoning, along with a need for freedom. Theory and
            abstracts don’t keep ESTP’s interested for long. ESTPs leap before they look,
            fixing their mistakes as they go, rather than sitting idle or preparing
            contingency plans.</p>

        <h2>The Supervisor – ESTJ Personality</h2>
        <p>ESTJs are organized, honest, dedicated, dignified, traditional, and are great
            believers of doing what they believe is right and socially acceptable. Though
            the paths towards “good” and “right” are difficult, they are glad to take
            their place as the leaders of the pack. They are the epitome of good
            citizenry. People look to ESTJs for guidance and counsel, and ESTJs are always
            happy that they are approached for help.</p>

        <h2>The Commander – ENTJ Personality</h2>
        <p>An ENTJ’s primary mode of living focuses on external aspects and all things
            are dealt with rationally and logically. Their secondary mode of operation is
            internal, where intuition and reasoning take effect. ENTJs are natural born
            leaders among the 16 personality types and like being in charge. They live in
            a world of possibilities and they often see challenges and obstacles as great
            opportunities to push themselves. They seem to have a natural gift for
            leadership, making decisions, and considering options and ideas quickly yet
            carefully. They are “take charge” people who do not like to sit still.</p>

        <h2>The Thinker – INTP Personality</h2>
        <p>INTPs are well known for their brilliant theories and unrelenting logic, which
            makes sense since they are arguably the most logical minded of all the
            personality types. They love patterns, have a keen eye for picking up on
            discrepancies, and a good ability to read people, making it a bad idea to lie
            to an INTP. People of this personality type aren’t interested in practical,
            day-to-day activities and maintenance, but when they find an environment where
            their creative genius and potential can be expressed, there is no limit to the
            time and energy INTPs will expend in developing an insightful and unbiased
            solution.</p>

        <h2>The Nurturer – ISFJ Personality</h2>
        <p>ISFJs are philanthropists and they are always ready to give back and return
            generosity with even more generosity. The people and things they believe in
            will be upheld and supported with enthusiasm and unselfishness. ISFJs are warm
            and kind-hearted. They value harmony and cooperation, and are likely to be
            very sensitive to other people’s feelings. People value the ISFJ for their
            consideration and awareness, and their ability to bring out the best in
            others.</p>

        <h2>The Visionary – ENTP Personality</h2>
        <p>Those with the ENTP personality are some of the rarest in the world, which is
            completely understandable. Although they are extroverts, they don’t enjoy
            small talk and may not thrive in many social situations, especially those that
            involve people who are too different from the ENTP. ENTPs are intelligent and
            knowledgeable need to be constantly mentally stimulated. They have the ability
            to discuss theories and facts in extensive detail. They are logical, rational,
            and objective in their approach to information and arguments.</p>

        <h2>The Composer – ISFP Personality</h2>
        <p>ISFPs are introverts that do not seem like introverts. It is because even if
            they have difficulties connecting to other people at first, they become warm,
            approachable, and friendly eventually. They are fun to be with and very
            spontaneous, which makes them the perfect friend to tag along in whatever
            activity, regardless if planned or unplanned. ISFPs want to live their life to
            the fullest and embrace the present, so they make sure they are always out to
            explore new things and discover new experiences. It is in experience that they
            find wisdom, so they do see more value in meeting new people than other
            introverts.</p>

        <h3>Myers–Briggs Type Indicator</h3>
        <p>A chart with descriptions of each Myers–Briggs personality type and the four
            dichotomies central to the theory.</p>
        <p>In personality typology, the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an
            introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological
            preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test
            attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or
            intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving. One letter from each
            category is taken to produce a four-letter test result, such as "INTJ" or
            "ESFP".</p>
        <p>Most of the research supporting the MBTI's validity has been produced by the
            Center for Applications of Psychological Type, an organization run by the
            Myers-Briggs Foundation, and published in the center's own journal, the
            Journal of Psychological Type (JPT), raising questions of independence, bias,
            and conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>Though the MBTI resembles some psychological theories, it has been criticized
            as pseudoscience and is not widely endorsed by academic researchers in the
            psychology field. The indicator exhibits significant scientific (psychometric)
            deficiencies, notably including:</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
            <li>
              poor validity (i.e. not measuring what it purports to measure, not having
              predictive power or not having items that can be generalized);
            </li>
            <li>
              poor reliability (giving different results for the same person on
              different occasions);
            </li>
            <li>
              measuring categories that are not independent (some dichotomous traits
              have been noted to correlate with each other);
            </li>
            <li>not being comprehensive (due to missing neuroticism).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The four scales used in the MBTI have some correlation with four of the Big
            Five personality traits, which is a more commonly accepted framework.</p>
